Differentiable Pooling PyTorch Implementation
=============================================

This is not official implementaion.

Currently reach 58% validation accuracy without link prediction loss 

[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.08804)

- Only tested on enzymes dataset
- Didn't support graph batching to accelerate

To run the code:
```
python diffpool_train.py
```
